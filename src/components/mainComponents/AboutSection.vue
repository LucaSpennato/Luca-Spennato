        In my late 20s I decided to turn my life around with Boolean's bootcamp. Before that I had many jobs, most of them in the restaurant industry, particularly as a pizza maker.

        An Italian guy working as a pizza maker, kinda odd right?

        Loved it, but it wasn't the life i've dreamed of.

        I've always been a curious guy, interested in technology and, as you can see, astronomy and space related stuff.
        <br>
        It was this curiosity that drove me to radically change my lifestyle and become a full stack web developer, making my passions and interests become my job!
